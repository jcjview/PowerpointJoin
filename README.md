Perl script may have some problem with perl win32 OLE.So I use powerpoint VBA to refactore this script. 

You can check code in userform3.frm. And there is no virus at all.

use RunAllInOne_plus.pptm run MACRO join to load.

It works in office 2013 and office 2010 in  windows XP win7 (X86) .But it has a problem that can't copy images when run in office 2007.

I have a very simple requirement that to have all slides in only one ppt.
So I work on this script to meet my requirement.

Put all the ppts in root folder, then run AllSlideInOne.pl.All in start.pptx.

That's it.

- Support .ppt files.
- Inserting keeps source formatting by modify reg.

To keep source ppts formatting you need to Modify the registry.You can get it in MS website [support en](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2433043/en "support.microsoft.com"). for Chinese :[如何改注册表，微软网站](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2433043/zh-cn).

###I wrote a *.reg file in /Win32/InsertSlideFromFileKeepSourceFormatting.reg.You can just run this file to import reg.

## About
I am grateful that the Lord Jesus Christ has given me the ability to write something useful that helps others. He has also given me a job that I enjoy, so I am happy to make this available for free.

Should you find this application useful and want to give back, I humbly ask that you consider making a donation to one of the following organizations:

*  [Christian Counseling Education Foundation](http://www.ccef.org/donate): CCEF's mission is to "Restore Christ to counseling and counseling to the church".

* [White Horse Inn](http://www.whitehorseinn.org/partnerships/support-us.html): The White Horse Inn is a blog and podcast that aims teach Christians to "know what they believe and why they believe it".

## GUI
I have built a crude graphic interface using wxPerl. Note that it doesn't yet support the --start-with option, that is, the ability to append files to a starting presentation. In order to use the GUI, you'll need to install the Wx module. See the Requirements sections for details on how to do this.

Once Wx is installed, you may then run

    PowerpointJoin-GUI.pl

to use the graphical version.

## Use case
Given several Powerpoint presentations, you want to merge them together. You could do it within Powerpoint, but perhaps you only want slides 1, 3, 8-9, and 20 from one deck, all of the next deck, and a few more onesy-twosy slides from various other decks.

## Requirements
This script is written in Perl. Perl is available for free from either [ActiveState](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads) or [Strawberry](http://www.strawberry.com). Once that is installed, you will also need to install two modules that may not already be installed. From a command prompt, type

    perl -MCPAN -e "install Win32::PowerPoint"

Once that completes, double check that the second module is installed by typing

    perl -MCPAN -e "install Win32::OLE"

If you want to use the GUI, you should also run

    perl -MCPAN -e "install Wx"

Now you're ready.

## Configuration file
The configuration file defines which the source charts and which slides from those files are used. Blank lines and lines that start with # are ignored.


**Example: insert all slides from each file**

    file=files\a.pptx
    file=files\b.pptx
    file=files\c.pptx

**Example**

    file=files\a.pptx
    slides=1-2,5,9-14

    file=files\b.pptx
    slides=3,5,6

    file=files\c.pptx
    slides=1,3-9
    
## Use
After downloading the zip file, extract them to your hard drive, for example, in c:\PowerpointJoin. Open a command prompt (Start | All Programs | Accessories | Command Prompt). Go to this directory by typing 

    cd c:\PowerpointJoin

Make sure that everything works by typing

    PowerpointJoin.pl

The response should look like the following:

    C:\PowerpointJoin>PowerPointJoin.pl
    Usage: C:\PowerpointJoin\PowerPointJoin.pl --conf
    ig <config_file> [--start-with <start.pptx> | --output <output.ppt>]


    The config file should have the following format:

    file=filename1.ppt
    slides=1-4,6-8,12

    file=filename2.ppt

    file=filename3.ppt
    slides=3

    The start and end lines are optional. start defaults to 1 and end
    defaults to the last slide in the file. The blank line betwen
    sections is option, but makes it readable if you have a lot of
    start/end lines.

To process your config file, assuming your config file is named "config.txt", type

    PowerpointJoin.pl --conf config.txt --output merged_charts.pptx

The merged charts will be in the file "merged_charts.pptx". Optionally, you may also do

    PowerpointJoin.pl --conf config.txt --start-with existing_charts.pptx

and the files defined in your config file will be appended to existing_charts.pptx. One advantage of doing it this way is that the theme of existing_charts.pptx will be preserved through the appended charts.
